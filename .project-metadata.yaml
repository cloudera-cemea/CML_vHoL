  DATA_LOCATION:
    default: my-data/churn_prototype
    description: >-
      Relative path that will be used to store the data used for this prototype.
      This should be a location you have write access to, and which is suitable for non-production data.
  HIVE_DATABASE:
    default: default
    description: >-
      Name of the Hive database that will be used to create the Hive table used for this prototype.
      This should be a Hive database you have write access to, and which is suitable for non-production data.
  HIVE_TABLE:
    default: churn_prototype
    description: >-
      Name of the Hive table that will be created and populated with the data used for this prototype.
      If the table already exists, the prototype will assume it already contains the data for this prototype.
